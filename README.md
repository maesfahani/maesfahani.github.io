## My Research

**Cosmology and String Theory:**
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [DESY Theory Group](https://theory-hamburg.desy.de/). Most of my work to date has been on inflation, a theory of the very early universe where the quantum fluctuations of one or more scalar fields gives rise to an initial distribution of gravitational wells. Matter sinking into these wells is thought to be the seeding process for the formation of all structure we observe today (galaxies, stars, people etc.). In my view, the most exciting consequence of this is that we can use the statistics of the distribution of matter in the universe to learn about particle physics at extremely high energies. Possibly much higher than we will ever be able to probe with terrestrial experiments. Indeed, cosmology may be one of our best hopes for testing string theory. As such, I try to sit between the string theory and cosmology communities, developing methods for computing predictions from string theory embeddings of inflation.

**Biology:**
In recent years it has been realised that the way in which the genome folds inside the cell nucleus (in humans, roughly two metres of DNA folds into a ten micron nucleus) plays an important role in gene expression programs and cell identity. It is also known that misfolding can give rise to disease. However, beyond this, very little is understood. Little is known about the mechanisms which enable this folding process, nor is  it understood _how_ the folding of the genome influences gene expression. My current work in collaboration with the [Marks Lab](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) in Harvard Medical School, seeks to address the latter question.

## Software

**The Transport Method:**
The transport method is a technique for computing the two-point and three-point correlation functions of fluctuations generated in an inflationary epoch during the early universe. Our site [transportmethod.com](https://transportmethod.com/) collects a number of tools written in Mathematica, C++ and Python.

**MULTIMODECODE:**
MultiModeCode is a Fortran 95/2000 package for the numerical exploration of multifield inflation models, available from [modecode.org](http://modecode.org/).

## Talks

I am trying to get into the habit of posting my slides from previous presentations on GitHub's Speaker Deck. My "Decks" can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jonnygfrazer).
